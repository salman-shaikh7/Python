# Python Fundamental Concepts
I will go over every fundamental python concepts from official document.


## **Motivation**
When I started to build ETL pipelines I realized that I am lacking basic knowledge in Python. I don't know built modules like argparser and logging. I also don't have idea how code execuation works behind the scenes.

Everytime I tried to solve any code or DSA question I had this feeling that I don't fundamental python concepts. I used to google them.

Now I decided to go through All the python documentation and learn all the fundamental concepts which will help me in learning ETL design as well as DSA.
